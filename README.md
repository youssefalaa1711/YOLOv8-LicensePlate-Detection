# 🚘 Car Plate Detection Using YOLOv8

This project demonstrates the use of [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for real-time vehicle license plate detection.  
The detection pipeline is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and OpenCV, with inference and visualization included.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Uses YOLOv8 pretrained model for car plate detection
- Performs inference on images using a Roboflow-hosted dataset
- Shows detection results with bounding boxes using OpenCV
- Notebook includes preprocessing, model loading, and detection steps

---

## 🧠 Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Roboflow API

## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the **`alyalsayed/egyptian-car-plates`** dataset hosted on [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com):

- Dataset is **not included** in this repository due to size and licensing.
- You can access the dataset via Roboflow's API using the existing code in the notebook.
